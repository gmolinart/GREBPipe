**Nature of Ideas: The Intangible Catalysts of Innovation**

In the vast expanse of human cognition, ideas stand out as unique entities. But what truly is the nature of an idea? Is it tangible, something we can touch, feel, and measure? Or is it intangible, existing only in the realms of our minds, waiting to be brought to life?

People start walking and then that litlte wedge turns in to chasm , rain water and time is maybe all it takes.

**Tangible vs. Intangible**

The debate between the **tangibility and intangibility of ideas** is not new. In many organizations, ideas are treated as matter, occupying space and often replacing one another. This perspective is limiting. Ideas, in their true essence, are **intangible**. They are *sparks of creativity*, not bound by the physical constraints of matter. They can *coexist, merge, evolve, and even conflict*, all within the same space.

**The Cohabitation of Ideas**

Can multiple ideas coexist without conflict? The answer is a resounding yes. In environments that foster innovation, ideas are encouraged to cohabit. It's in these spaces that the '*aha*' moments, the '*holy shit*' realizations, emerge. When ideas are allowed to flow freely, without the constraints of matter, they lead to groundbreaking innovations. Do you think of ideas as matter where two can't ocupy the same space, two entities that dont combine?  or do we think of ideas as light where the more you add the brighter it gets?. 

**Ideas: Processes vs. Static Entities**

**Ideas are not static**. They are *dynamic processes, constantly evolving, adapting, and growing*. Treating them as static entities limits their potential. An idea, when nurtured, can morph into something entirely different, leading to solutions previously unimagined.

**Legacy Software and Corporate Challenges**

Herein lies a paradox. Large corporations, with their vast resources and knowledge, often find themselves shackled by legacy systems. That are inneficient. While they possess more know-how than smaller startups, they are also burdened by outdated software languages and systems. The challenge is to balance the need to continue generating revenue while also reinventing. If we decide to do this inside or companies or in universities and other organizations is besides the point

> Building new ideas on old foundations is a recipe for disaster, leading to complex systems that miss the mark, Instead focusion on learning on the previous generation and architecture that foster replacing components is a much better combination. It's often up to individual contribuiters to seek oportunities to develop new ideas.

The higher level languguages abstact away from the complexity but also means that if we don't have a core understanding of what they do they carry over unnecesary solutions that were only there to patch a limitation. That leads to complications or the yikes moments that are only 10% due because of the increased coomplexity, the entropy caused by this incresed complexity spins systems out of nimbleness. 



**Understanding Complexity through Astronomy**

Historically, our understanding of planetary movements was constrained by our beliefs. We clung to the idea of circular orbits, unable to reconcile our observations with religious beliefs. It was only when we embraced the idea of elliptical orbits that we truly began to understand the cosmos. This shift underscores the importance of **challenging established theories** and the dangers of losing our innovative spirit.

**Simplicity through Sophistication**

In the Yikes curved as mentioned the noise is all sort of things 

* bad technique
* old technique
* human stumbling
* inhability to learn


The suspicion is that the old bang for our buck 


True simplicity is achieved not by dumbing down but by adopting more sophisticated building blocks. Relying on overly simplistic foundations can lead to complications down the road. There's a resistance to change, especially in established sectors, but this resistance hampers progress. To move forward, we must embrace change, even if it means *abandoning long-held beliefs*.

In conclusion, ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They are intangible, dynamic, and limitless. By understanding their true nature and fostering an environment where they can coexist and evolve, we pave the way for groundbreaking advancements. Whether in the realm of software or the vast expanse of the cosmos, the principles remain the same: **challenge, evolve, and innovate**.
