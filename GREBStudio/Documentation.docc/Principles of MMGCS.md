**Sketchpad: A Revolutionary Leap in Computer Graphics**

The essence of the Sketchpad thesis was the development of a pioneering computer program that allowed a user to interact with a computer graphically. Before Sketchpad, interactions with computers were primarily text-based. Sutherland's work introduced the concept of using a light pen to draw and manipulate objects directly on a computer screen, making it the first graphical user interface of its kind.

**Key Features and Innovations of Sketchpad:**

1. **Interactive Graphics:** Users could draw on the screen using a light pen. This was revolutionary at the time and laid the foundation for modern graphical user interfaces.
2. **Object-Oriented Approach:** Sketchpad introduced the idea of "master drawings" and "instances." A user could create a master drawing, and then create instances of that drawing, which were like clones. Any changes made to the master drawing would reflect in all its instances.
3. **Constraints:** Another innovative feature was the ability to define geometric constraints. For example, a user could specify that two lines should remain perpendicular, and Sketchpad would ensure that this constraint was maintained even if one of the lines was moved or modified.
4. **Memory Structures:** Sketchpad had a unique way of storing objects. Each object remembered which other objects it was connected to, allowing for complex structures and relationships to be built and manipulated.
5. **Real-time Feedback:** As users drew or modified objects, the system provided real-time feedback, making it a truly interactive experience.

**Impact and Legacy:**

Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad thesis was not just about creating a drawing tool. It was a paradigm shift in how humans could interact with computers. It laid the groundwork for the development of computer-aided design (CAD) systems and has influenced the way we interact with computers even today.

Moreover, the object-oriented and constraint-based approach introduced by Sketchpad has had lasting implications in programming and software design.

In conclusion, Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad was a monumental leap in the world of computer graphics and human-computer interaction. It transformed the way we think about computer interfaces and set the stage for many of the graphical systems we use today.
