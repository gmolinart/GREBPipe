Historical Overview:
Linux:

Primarily written in C.
Some parts are in assembly.
Linux was designed to be 386 dependent, utilizing the features of the 386 architecture.
Some files contain almost as much assembler as C.
Linux does not hide the reason behind interrupts.
Mac OS X:

Cocoa (the application programming interface for macOS) is mostly in Objective-C.
The kernel is primarily written in C with some parts in assembly.
Mac OS X's kernel layer is based on BSD (an older, free operating system) and is mostly C.
Windows:

Written in C, C++, and C#.
Some areas of the code are hand-tuned or hand-written in assembly.
Unix:

Primarily written in C.
Some parts are in assembly.
Analysis for 2023:
As of 2023, the landscape of operating system development has evolved, but many of the foundational principles remain. Here's a general overview:

Languages:

C and C++ continue to be the dominant languages for kernel and low-level system development due to their performance and control over hardware.
Rust has gained popularity for system programming, especially in the Linux community, due to its focus on memory safety without sacrificing performance. Some parts of newer operating systems and system tools are being written or rewritten in Rust.
Assembly is still used, but sparingly, for very low-level tasks or performance-critical sections.
Linux:

The Linux kernel continues to be primarily written in C.
There are initiatives to incorporate Rust into the Linux kernel for better memory safety.
The userland has diversified with applications written in various languages, including Python, Go, and Rust.
macOS:

Apple introduced Swift, which has been integrated into their ecosystem. While Objective-C remains in use, Swift is becoming more prevalent for application development on macOS.
The kernel remains primarily in C, but with continuous optimizations and updates.
Windows:

Windows continues to be developed in C, C++, and C#.
Microsoft has been pushing for .NET 5 and later versions, which unify the .NET platform, making it easier to write cross-platform applications.
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has seen significant improvements, allowing for better Linux integration on Windows machines.
Other Developments:

Containerization and virtualization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes have influenced how operating systems are perceived and interacted with.
There's a trend towards "lightweight" operating systems optimized for container orchestration.
Security has become even more critical, with a focus on secure coding practices, regular patching, and updates.
In summary, while the foundational languages for operating system development remain C and C++, there's a clear trend towards incorporating newer, safer languages like Rust. Additionally, the boundaries between different OSs are blurring, with better cross-compatibility and integration features.



Performance Comparison:
macOS:

Hardware Integration: macOS is designed specifically for Apple hardware. This tight integration between software and hardware often results in optimized performance, as the OS can be fine-tuned for a specific set of devices.
File System: With the introduction of the Apple File System (APFS), macOS gained a boost in speed, especially for file operations.
Graphics: macOS uses Metal for graphics, which provides near-direct access to the GPU, enhancing graphics performance.
Windows:

Versatility: Windows is designed to run on a wide variety of hardware configurations, from high-end desktops to budget laptops. This versatility can sometimes mean compromises in performance optimization for specific hardware.
File System: NTFS, the primary file system for Windows, is robust and has been improved over the years, but it might not be as fast as some newer file systems.
Graphics: Windows uses DirectX for graphics, which is a collection of APIs designed to handle multimedia tasks, especially game programming and video.
Linux:

Customizability: One of Linux's strengths is its flexibility. Users can choose lightweight distributions or desktop environments if performance is a concern. This makes Linux ideal for both older hardware and high-performance servers.
File System: Linux supports a variety of file systems, with ext4 being the most popular. Btrfs and ZFS are newer file systems that offer advanced features and can potentially provide performance benefits.
Graphics: Linux graphics are primarily handled through OpenGL or Vulkan. The open-source nature of Linux has sometimes led to challenges with proprietary graphics drivers, though this situation has improved over the years.
Swift and System Performance:
If Apple were to transition to using only Swift for system code:

Memory Safety: Swift is designed with a focus on memory safety. This could lead to fewer crashes and system vulnerabilities due to memory-related bugs.

Performance: Swift is a compiled language with performance comparable to C++ for many tasks. However, certain system-level tasks might still benefit from the fine-grained control offered by languages like C or assembly.

Development Speed: Swift's modern syntax and features can lead to faster development and easier maintenance. This could result in more frequent updates and feature additions.

Interoperability: Transitioning to Swift doesn't mean abandoning existing code. Swift has excellent interoperability with C and Objective-C, so critical system components written in these languages could still be used.

Challenges: Rewriting large portions of an OS in a new language is a monumental task. It would require extensive testing to ensure stability and performance. Additionally, while Swift is great for application-level code, it might not be the best choice for very low-level system components.

In summary, while macOS, Windows, and Linux each have their performance strengths and trade-offs, the choice often comes down to user preference, specific use cases, and hardware. As for Swift, while it offers many modern features and benefits, a complete transition to Swift for system-level code would be a significant undertaking with both potential advantages and challenges.
