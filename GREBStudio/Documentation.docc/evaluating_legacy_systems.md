So you've been assigned a task: to build a rocket for a mission. Sounds exciting, right? Now, depending on what you want this mission to achieve, the design and development of your rocket will greatly vary. That's where criteria come into play. These are like guidelines or goals that help you decide what success will look like for your mission.

Let's explore two different sets of criteria, and how they might affect the outcome:

**Criteria Set 1:** Suppose your goal is to create a rocket that can carry a payload of scientific instruments into low Earth orbit. Here, your primary considerations might be the payload capacity, the rocket's ability to reach a certain altitude, and the successful deployment of the payload. The success of your mission, in this case, depends on these specific objectives. So, your rocket design will focus more on efficiency and precise engineering to meet these criteria.

**Criteria Set 2:** Alternatively, let's imagine your mission isn't about sending a payload into orbit, but about transporting humans to the International Space Station (ISS). Now, your criteria have dramatically changed. Besides considering the rocket's ability to reach the ISS, you also have to factor in the safety of the astronauts, life support systems, and ease of navigation. Here, the success of your mission hinges on human factors as much as the technical aspects of rocket design.

By defining these criteria before starting the project, you can make sure that everyone involved is working towards the same goals. This kind of clarity helps prevent misunderstandings and keeps everyone on track.

In the Criteria set 1 you could say that the key things the system needs to do is :

- carry the payload
- stability
- speed
- automated navigation

One might then come up with a design that’s small super fast and is super reliable

Analyzing the second set of criteria you might arrive to the conclusion that the system needs to

- carry the astronauts
- have emergency systems
- have an intuitive system
- stability
- not kill the crew

In this design the speed isn't as important, and although stability and  carrying the payload are shared features the list expands to have a more specific set of criteria. Automated navigation is not necessary because the cabin can be driven by the pilots but we do need emergency systems.

At Animallogic we’ve been designing rockets for a while, and we have great core systems, all the components required for different space missions/rockets. However every rocket has been made for a particular project/mission and we’re reaching a point where we’d like to have some consistency across the new stuff that get’s developed and the core systems that every spaceship should have.

The main idea is that we should have core systems that are consistent/battle tested and get updated when new developments are made but always keeping the ease of use and the ability to automatically build based on those configurations.

In order to get to that point we need to define and respect the history of our system, and align with criterias.

> In the world of technology, we often encounter a fascinating concept known as "alignable differences." It's kind of like having a new toy that reminds you of an older one you used to love. It's new and exciting but familiar at the same time. That's what makes it easier for us to understand and use.
> 
> A fun example to illustrate this is how programmers today still stick to a rule of keeping their lines of code within 80 columns. You might wonder, why 80? The answer takes us back in time to the mid-20th century, when the first room-sized computers were operated with punch cards. These cards had 80 columns for data entry. So, when you see a line of code today, it's indirectly influenced by technology from over half a century ago!
> 
> Let's go a step further back in time to understand why these computers used punch cards. Well, it turns out they borrowed the idea from the telegraph industry. Telegraph operators had to ensure they didn't make mistakes while sending critical messages. To help with this, they used keyboards to punch holes in paper tape that they could check before sending the message.
> 
> But where did the telegraph industry get the idea from? From 18th-century French weavers! They used punch cards to automate the design patterns of their rugs. And just like that, an interface used by weavers ended up in modern-day computing.

> This just goes to show how technology progresses in cycles, constantly borrowing ideas from different fields and time periods. It's like technology is a great big sponge, absorbing all these ideas and patterns, and occasionally holding onto elements that might not make much sense anymore.
> 
> While this is all super interesting, it's also a bit of a double-edged sword when it comes to maintaining technology. If we just keep adding on new bits without ever letting go of the old, it becomes like a game of tech Jenga. Pull out one outdated piece, and the whole tower might come tumbling down because it's so intertwined and built upon old assumptions.
> 
> That's why it's crucial to strike a balance when maintaining technology. It's a bit like gardening – you can't just keep planting new flowers without occasionally pruning the old ones. Staying current with advancements is important, but we also need to regularly trim back the outdated parts. That way, when it's time for a big overhaul, it's less like archaeology and more like upgrading to a new, better version.

For maintaining technology long term, the challenge lies in striking a balance between preserving familiarity (and thus usability) and keeping up-to-date with technological advancements. If systems are kept stagnant for too long, it can lead to a daunting task of migrating decades of ingrained assumptions and outdated features when an update eventually becomes necessary.

**Core Principles for Documentation:**

1. **Alignable Differences:** When introducing new technology or systems, include aspects that align with familiar, older systems. This will help users understand and adopt the new technology more easily.
2. **Historical Context:** Understanding the history of a technology and its features can shed light on why certain aspects are the way they are. This can help in making decisions about what features to preserve, modify, or discard in future versions.
3. **Balancing Act:** There's a need for balance in maintaining technology. Blindly adopting new things can be risky, but not updating can also be dangerous due to the accumulation of outdated or unnecessary features.
4. **Migration Considerations:** If systems are not updated for a long time, a lot of outdated assumptions may need to be addressed during migration. Regular updates can help to mitigate this issue.

By understanding these principles, technology teams can better navigate the complexities of managing both aging and modern systems. It can guide them in evaluating what aspects to retain, revise, or remove, ensuring a smoother transition for end-users and reducing the risk of complications in system upgrades or migrations.

Some key questions to ask are

- Who will be maintaining this system long term?
- What technologies are they comfortable with?
- Who will be using this system the most?
- How do they expect the system to work?
